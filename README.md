# README

The task was to create a basic ruby on rails web app which displays 'Authors' and their corresponding ID. This app displays the basic Ruby on Rails CRUD functions in use, due to being able to create, edit and delete authors to the database connected. You are also able to add a book to a specific author by selecting the ID of the author on a drop down table.

# How to open
1. open files in atom
2. Run 'rails s' in the terminal
3. then go to http://localhost:3000/authors or http://localhost:3000/books
